# Advance-File-Organizer-Bot

# Problem Statement:

Modern users often deal with cluttered download folders or directories full of random files. Manually organizing them by file type, size, or extension is time-consuming. This project addresses this problem by providing a real-time automated file organizer that monitors a folder and instantly sorts new files as they arrive.

# Project Overview:

This Python-based desktop application allows users to select a folder and automaticallyorganize files based on:

- File extension (e.g., .jpg, .pdf)
- File type (e.g., image, document, video)
- File size (small, medium, large)
  
It also provides real-time monitoring using the Watchdog library, meaning new files are sorted instantly as they are added. The tool comes with a Tkinter-based GUI, allowing users to start organizing without typing a single command.
